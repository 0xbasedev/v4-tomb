# Canonical Masonry spec (xTOMB / xSHARE)

Synthesized 2026-11-05 from the docs below plus the owner's decisions. Where documents disagree, this file says which wins. Change it only with an owner decision.

## Precedence

1. Owner decisions (section below).
2. `MASONRY_V4_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`: economics backed by code.
3. `MASONRY_MERGE_RECONCILIATION_2026-11-04.md`: status, gates G1–G8, constraints.
4. `config/masonry-launch.template.json`: parameter values.
5. `HANDOFF_LOCAL_LAUNCH.md`, `CLAUDE_NEXT_STEPS.md`: process.
6. `MASONRY_MERGE_PLAN.md`: historical. Unbuilt ideas only (Farm, Exit Now, arbitrage, wallet limits); none approved.

## Owner decisions

- Public names xTOMB / xSHARE. Source names PegToken / ShareToken. Older docs say LEVEL / SQUARE: naming only.
- Base first. BSC later as a bridge satellite (Bridged xSHARE, one 33,333 cap). Bridge stays off until peers, ISMs, limits and relayers are verified.
- xBOND after launch. No bond mechanics in the Masonry runtime.
- **Genesis pool 0 asset: USDC** (6 decimals). Read on-chain via `staking.standardAsset()`.
- **Automation: as implemented.** Pro/Ultra only, opt-in keeper with a minimum-net-output floor, 2% performance fee on the liquid amount, no $50 fee. Manual compounding has no performance fee. Farm/Masonry automation pricing is decided with those modules.
- **Unused Genesis emissions and rounding dust: Treasury.** Not yet implemented in `MasonryGenesisStaking`; it must be a visible, documented Treasury sweep. Do not let it become an owner-discretionary withdrawal.
- **Launch scope: full protocol** (Genesis, Treasury expansion, Farm, Masonry). Longest path. Suggested build order: G1 deploy graph, G3 tokens, G2 Treasury, G5 Farm/Masonry, then G6–G8.
- CreateX/CREATE3 for every project address. Chain selection lives in the Wizard. Genesis may deploy unscheduled; the scheduler sets the date once after funding and wiring.

## Genesis

- 7 days. Official LP pool and compounding open at start + 24h and close at Genesis end. Claims and principal withdrawals stay open afterwards. Ultra may pre-stake in pool 0 up to 24h before start.
- Passes (soulbound, not transferable; USDC to Treasury): Genesis $50, Pro $100, Ultra $500 total. Everyone needs a pass to take part in Genesis; the $50 Genesis pass has no perks beyond participation. Buy any tier outright, or start lower and `upgrade()` in place for only the difference ($50 to Pro, $400 more to Ultra); the total paid is identical either way, and the same token is kept. Upgrades close when Genesis ends. Equal reward weight for every tier. All staking and reward entry points require a pass.
- Perks: Genesis none. Pro: opt-in keeper compounding. Ultra: everything in Pro plus pool-0 pre-stake up to 24h before start, at the same rate and start time as everyone else. (Perks as shown in the Genesis UI; unconfirmed beyond that.)
- Emissions: 100% to pool 0 on Day 1; from Day 2, 75% LP / 25% pool 0.
- Rewards: 50% liquid, 50% escrow in 16 claim-gated 6-hour installments, first at end + 6h. Same schedule for all tiers.
- Fees: one 50 bps LP-share fee per deposit or compound (burns xTOMB; USDC leg buys back and burns when the guard allows, otherwise escrowed and retried only by later authorized Genesis activity). 2% claim-to-wallet fee to Treasury. 2% keeper performance fee. Shared 3-hour claim/compound cooldown per beneficiary per pool.
- Compound: caller supplies xTOMB sell amount and gross LP shares plus a net-share floor. Unused inputs return to the beneficiary, capped at 3% plus dust.

## Taxes and defense

- xTOMB sell tax: max of ordinary TWAP target, projected execution target, recovery floor, and 3% during Genesis. 12% hard cap. Single debit, burned during Genesis; outside Genesis it goes to the fee recipient. Buys and transfers 0%.
- xSHARE sell tax: same engine, 6% Genesis floor, 12% cap. Normal split of collected tax: 12% POL, 20% USDC reserve, 68% retained xSHARE.
- Critical Defense: enters at fresh TWAP ≤ 0.90; 100% of new eligible xSHARE fees go to xTOMB buy-and-burn; earlier earmarks unchanged. Exits after two consecutive real 6-hour checkpoints with fresh TWAP > 1.01. Stale data never ends it.
- No owner/keeper trading pause. No governance timelocks. Optional secondary operations must never revert the original sale or deposit.

## Supply

- xSHARE: cap 33,333, farming 25,641 over 365 days, sale escrow 100, deployer 1, owner/team/dev 100, treasury 500, arbitrage 50. The remaining **6,941** vesting split (team, developer, treasury, arbitrage; 180-day streams) is **not authorized**. Do not invent it.
- xTOMB: `authorizedLaunchSupply` and the Genesis reward budget are **unset**. Initial: owner/team/dev 5,000, treasury 5,000, arbitrage 1,000.
- Token contracts must expose cumulative total burned. The Genesis LP-fee burn counter is a subset, never added twice.

## Treasury expansion (not built; blocker G2)

Mint only on fresh TWAP strictly > 1.01, max 2% of circulating xTOMB per 6-hour epoch, no catch-up for missed epochs, no stale-oracle bypass. The inherited `core/Treasury.sol` is WETH/bond-era and must not ship as Masonry.

## Still open

6,941 split; `authorizedLaunchSupply`; reward budget; Genesis deposit-fee policy (the 50 bps LP fee is separate); multi-pool Genesis; tier perks beyond the base; Harvest All / Compound All / Robot Arms; Farm migration; target-chain calibration (liquidity floor, TWAP cadence, guard tolerances, tick range).
